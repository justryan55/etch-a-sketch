Create a 16x16 grid of square grids 
    - create the divs using javascript
    - put grid squares inside another 'container' div (can go directly in the HTML)
    - use flexbox to make divs appear as a grid 

Set up a 'hover' effect so the grid divs change colour when your mouse passes over them
    - 'hovering' occurs when your mouse enters a div and ends when your mouse leaves it 
        - can set up event listeners for either of those points as a starting point
    
Add button that prompts user to select grid side
    - this should remove existing grid and a new grid should be generated in the same total space 



Buttons - grid size, resize, clear
